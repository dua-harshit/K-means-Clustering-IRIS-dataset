# K-means-Clustering-IRIS-dataset
This is a Unsupervised Machine Learning model using the KMeans Clustering Algorithm implemented on the IRIS data set, to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent them visually. I have used the 'The Elbow' Method to find the optimum number of clusters.

## Libraries used
pandas - python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

numpy - python library used to perform high-level mathematical functions on large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

matpltlib - python library used for ploting data.

Scikit-learn - is a python library used for creating machine learning models of classification, regression and clustering.
